    "New York City and Toronto are financial centers of the United States and Canada, respectively. They both have a great diversity of multicultural places and venues. This is where I will leverage Foursquare. The purpose of this project is to compare New York and Toronto in terms of the popularity of venues and find out which venues tend to be most popular in each city. This project can be used by individuals looking to opening a business in either of those cities and find out which businesses/industries tend to be most popular in each city. "
